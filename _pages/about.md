Welcome to my website! 

I am an experienced researcher in the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), currently looking for a new challenge. I earned my PhD in Information Retrieval at the [Technion, Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/). In my thesis study, I developed algorithms for entity retrieval and for semantic document search under the guidance of [Prof. Oren Kurland](https://iew3.technion.ac.il/~kurland/). I explored similar topics as a research intern at [IBM research](https://research.ibm.com/labs/haifa/) and [Yahoo! Labs](https://research.yahoo.com/) in Haifa. My most recent position was as a senior data scientist at [AI21Labs](https://www.ai21.com/), where I worked on various NLP challenges including word sense disambiguation, word substitution, and human evaluation. 

I hold a BSc in Physics and Mathematics from the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/en), earned as part of the [Talpiot elite officer's training program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program). My Master's degree is in Physics and I earned it at [Tel Aviv university](https://english.tau.ac.il/). In my Master's thesis, I studied the effects of [Diffusing Aloha-emitters Radiation Therapy (DART)](https://www.alphatau.com/) on different solid tumors. 

I am interested in semantic representations of language, knowledge representations, and related applications. Also, I am intrigued by the acquisition of language by children and literacy learning.  

I am the proud mother of three children. Passionate about education and ways that technology, specifically artificial intelligence, can benefit children of all ages. My hobbies include creating art, writing, and volunteering in our local schools.
